  I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu">Department of Linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu">University of California, Santa Barbara</a> and a member of the Speech, Prosody, and Articulatory Kinematics (SPArK) Laboratory. My current research projects touch on L1 and L2 phonetics, phonetics-prosody interface, articulatory phonology, and computational linguistics.
