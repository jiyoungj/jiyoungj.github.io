  Welcome! I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu">Department of Linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu">University of California, Santa Barbara</a> and a member of the Speech, Prosody, and Articulatory Kinematics (SPArK) Laboratory. My current research projects touch on L1/L2 phonetics, phonetics-prosody interface, articulatory phonology, and computational linguistics.

  Before coming to UCSB, I received my master's degree in English Linguistics from Hanyang University, South Korea, and was a member of the <a href="https://site.hanyang.ac.kr/web/tcho/phonetics-lab">Hanyang Institute for Phonetics and Cognitive Sciences of Language (HIPCS)</a>.
